This is a ipversions, a munin plugin to analyze traffic flowing through a
Linux router by IP version. It draws two graphs, one displaying the ratio of
v4/v6 traffic in percent, and one displaying absolute throughput values in
bytes/s.

  SETUP
---------------------------------------
For this plugin to work, you need to setup seperate iptables chains,
redirect all traffic from the forwarding chains through these chains and
add a filter rule that matches all traffic. These commands should do the
trick:

  iptables -N ACCT_IPVER
  ip6tables -N ACCT_IPVER
  iptables -I FORWARD -j ACCT_IPVER
  ip6tables -I FORWARD -j ACCT_IPVER
  iptables -A ACCT_IPVER
  ip6tables -A ACCT_IPVER

The plugin assumes there is exactly one rule in the ACCT_IPVER chain,
strange things may happen if there are more rules. If you need more rules to
monitor different aspects of the traffic flow, add extra chains for that.

ipversions needs to be executed as root, otherwise iptables won't talk to us.
Achieve this by adding a section in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node:

  [ipversions]
  user root
